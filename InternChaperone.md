# iOS Development Intern Chaperone

Took responsibility over iOS development intern for a duration of two months. During which was responsible for teaching best development principles and fundamentals of programming, creating development tasks, reviewing work, creating designs and prototypes.

Intern learnt about OOP, MVC structural design pattern, Swift programming fundamentals (_eg. control flow, classes, structs, enums, methods, types, variables, view and application lifecycles, operators, networking_), had insight in 3<sup>rd</sup> party libraries, and dependency management (_CocoaPods, Carthage, static libraries_), Unit testing and application debugging, Gitflow Workflow (_creating branch per feature/task, making pull requests, addressing opened issues, code reviewing_).

Dedicated time to simulate real Agile Scrum development environment - created custom tasks for intern, developing applications for those, used Sketch to draw designs, Zeplin to distribute designs and InVision to create application prototypes, created custom static libraries for use during tasks, had daily stand-ups and by weekly pair-programming, discussion/Q&A sessions, created GitHub organisation as version control tool and Trello boards as task tracking tool, reviewed pull requests, opened issues, wrote assignment requirements.

Finally, organised iOS junior interview - technical query as well as practical assignment to evaluate knowledge and pinpoint weaknesses.

Afterwards, had additional discussions regarding future tasks to improve his skills as iOS developer. Talked with management and proactively looked for project that would be willing to undertake young developer. Kept checking-in with intern on a monthly basis, to review his progress.
